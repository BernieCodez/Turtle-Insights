      <h1>Turtle Insights</h1>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Turtles are one of the most amazing creatures God gave us. This is why
        Turtle Insights have poured in hours of research about them. You'll find
        every fact you need about Sea Turtles like their habitats, lifestyle,
        predators and prey, and so much more! All the information we use comes
        from very reliable sources. Don't believe us? You can go to the sources
        page to see where we got our information.
      </p>
      <h2>Shells</h2>
      <p>
        The carapace and plastron both have two layers. One layer is flat bones
        that merge with the turtle's ribs as it grows. The other layer consists
        of scutes which protect the turtle. For most turtles, the scutes are
        made of keratin. But for Leatherbacks they have a rubbery material
        called caraplace with leather to protect them. A turtle shell is also
        the home to small organisms called epibionts. They are small creatures
        like algae, small crabs, barnacles, etc. There are over 100 epibionts
        discovered living on a sea turtle's shell. The weight of these creatures
        will weigh the turtle down but luckily certain fish enjoy eating the
        epibionts making it a win win for both sides. The turtle gets a clean
        shell and the fish gets a nice meal.
      </p>
      <h2>Senses</h2>
      <h3>Sight</h3>
      <p>
        Turtles have vision that has adapted to both the land and the water
        although since a turtle spends most of its time in water, its vision
        underwater is better compared to land. They have perfect vision
        underwater and a slight nearvision on land. This is because their eyes
        have flat corneas and a nearly spherical lens. Interestingly, turtle
        eyes are more adapted to bright light instead of the dark. If they need
        to feed in the depths or in the dark they rely on seeing the
        bioluminesce of their prey to feed. A study in 2012 showed that green
        sea turtles and loggerhead turtles both have the cells required for
        seeing color but not many studies have been conducted to show whether
        they can distinguish the color they see.
      </p>
      <h3>Hearing</h3>
      <p>
        Turtle's ears are so small they can't be seen on the outside of its
        head. Their ear allows them to hear vibrations traveling through the
        water. Studies suggest turtles also have the ability to detect low
        frequency sounds because of a protective layer of skin over their ear
        called tympanum. Underneath the tympanum is a layer of fat only sea
        turtles have. Scientists believe the fat channels the low frequency
        sound waves into the ear and is what allows turtles to hear the loew
        frequency sounds.
      </p>
      <h3>Touch</h3>
      <p>
        An interesting fact about sea turtles is that they have sensory nerves
        inside of their shell that detect pressure. This means when their shells
        are touched they can detect it. Although scientists believe they can't
        detect pain. Turtles have sensory nerves in their head and flippers.
      </p>
      <h3>Smell</h3>
      <p>
        Turtles have an acute sense of smell. This combined with their sight
        allows them to easily track their prey. Scientists think that female
        turtles also use their sense of smell to navigate to a beach and lay
        eggs.
      </p>
      <h3>Magnetic sense</h3>
      <p>
        Turtles have a unique ability called magnetic sense. It allows them to
        detect magnetic fields that they use to navigate. Scientists aren't
        quite sure how it works. It is a turtle's equivalent to a compass.
